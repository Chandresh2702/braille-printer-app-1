# CHANGES - OpenPrinting Braille Printer Application v2.0b1 - 2022-11-14

## CHANGES IN V2.0b1 (TBA)

- textbrftoindex: Fix control character filtering (Pull
  request #409)

- Build system: Remove '-D_PPD_DEPRECATED=""' from the
  compiling command lines of the source files which use
  libcups. The flag is not supported any more for longer times
  already and all the PPD-related functions deprecated by CUPS
  have moved into libppd now.

- Build system: Add files in gitignore that are generated by
  "autogen.sh", "configure", and "make" (Pull request #336).
